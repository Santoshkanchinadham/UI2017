browsers intrepret the elements via two ways:

1. block level element:has dimensions.
2. inline level element: doesn't have dimensions.it takes the dimensions from its child element

examples of block level elements are:
1. body
2. div: short for divisions
3. section, article, header, footer

examples of inline are:
1. span
2. a
3. image

in html5, a new concept was introduced called "trinity":
<article>
  <header></header>
  <section></section>
  <footer></footer>
</article>


h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6

there are two ways of having lists in html:
1.unordered list
2.ordered list

the elements <ul> and <ol> can have only one child element and that is <li> (a list)
semantic html

what is attribute in html
an attribute in html basically describes its characteristics

there are several attributes available for us but few are standard for all elements:
1. id- describes the uniqueness of the element
2. class - this shares common values between elements

<attribute name>="<value>"
example:
<header id="heading"></header>

adding comments in html
comments - these are helpful tips left by developer

to comment a line or a block of lines in html, we use <!-- -->

<form>
  <div>
     <input>
     <button>
  </div>
</form>

there are two main components with which html gets rendered by the browser:
1. Tag - a tag has closing tag name ex: <header> </header>
2. element - elements in html are fields which accept some sort of inputs. They dont have a closing field

every element has a required attribute which needs to be added at any cost

form after submitting the form, table is rendered

newLicenseForm - Camel casing in programming language.

every input field must have "id" attribute and "name" attribute

Head holds the metadata
A metadata is nothing but a data about data.
